# Restaurant GraphQL

This is an exercise as part of Module 24 of MIT xPro Full Stack Bootcamp

This project is part of a programming assignment that focuses on using GraphQL to query and update restaurant data. The goal is to build a GraphQL server that provides a simplified view of the data and makes it easier to retrieve and modify restaurant information.
